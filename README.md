# pythonGPSCom
 Python Driver App for Wifi Surveys

## Purpose
 This script will run on a modern Windows Operating System (Tested on Windows 10 and 11) with a USB based GPS dongle, using u-center software, that can appear as a serial port. The detail record is echoed to the console and written a SQLlite database locally for additional analysis. To gather the Wifi data the script queries the operating system.

## Instruction
